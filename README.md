# Mock API

I wrote two scripts. One of them parses the KML and stores a ruby object in a file, the other filters the resulting file by date ranges and store the result as JSON.

I'm happy to move this back to node for the sake of having **everything in javascript** but I was having trouble figuring stuff out and I just wanted to get something done.

Read the comments at the head of each .rb file for instructions.
